# SteamAudio
A project that implements the Steam Audio binaural sound rendering for the Vive.

Dependencies
This project requires the [SteamVR](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647) asset to be imported and the [SteamAudio](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/downloads.html) Unity package. Put the Photon and Plugins folder into the SteamAudio folder to prevent git from trying to upload it (files are too large).
